For the project i will be building n*n tic tac toe.

I do most of my logic writing and designing on my notepad using pen and paper, so will attach all those things with the mail.

This is my first attempt at a react project with typescript so there will be a lot of google searches involved. I will keep explaining my steps in the readme file.

* Since i am doing this in between my meetings and office schedules, this might be broken up into parts, although i will try my best to cover it in sections and pick up from where i leave of.

Steps involved:

During my initial days of learning React , i built the basic 3*3 tic tac toe present in the React tutorial, so my current n*n tic tac toe will be inspired by it a little. 

1) Clean up the starter code
2) Building the rough UI on paper (Mostly figmas are provided to me but when i am building something on my own i like to draw it out on paper). Will attach the same
3) Based on my current thinking i will be making following components which might help me get the whole app together in the end:
a) Game Component => TicTac main code
b) Board Component => Where the design will be rendered
c) Square / Cell Component => Where the user will click and the move is decided
d) Winner Screen => Once a winner is decided may be an overlay screen that has an option to restart the game 
e) History Component => As i mentioned this is inspired by the react tutorial, i will try and implement state management to manage the past moves so the user can go back and decide.


In a typical React project i usually build my components as follows:
components-folder/
        component-name/-
                        component-name.container.jsx = This involves all the state related tasks and async tasks 
                        component-name.component.jsx = this is just for the view part 
                        component-name.style.scss = I usually prefer scss because i try to avoid nested codes using this. Else css works fine
                        component-name.styling.jsx = My favorite library to use is styled-components but i implement it only when i know i have ample time, so this is last step.

For a typescript version of the app the extension would be .tsx as read from the documentation


Folder steps
1) Game => //Since this component will include the state it will be a class
2) Since this has to be an n*n tic tac toe, i will be keeping in mind not to hardcode the value of "n" but for starter logics i am considering a 3*3 matrix.
And since each square will be clickable with an attached on click event the best way is to make each square as a button


//Sorry had a meeting at 2.

First i will try to make the squares rendered dynamic since the styling og squares will depend on the number passed

//Deciding the styles logic in notebook

For the value of n provided a loop should be run that determines the display element should have the style "inline-block" or "block"

I usually make a sticky note of all the tasks or code refactoring i will be doing later to remember if something is to be changed 


//Restarting fresh on the onclick logic.. Got confused


The function has to be passed from Game component to Board component to Square component so that when square component is clicked, the state in the parent component (Game) modifies.


Checking in the code till it works correctly
